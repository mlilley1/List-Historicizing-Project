    <h1>HTML List Tags and the History of &lt;Lists&gt;</h1>
  </a>


<body>

In Christina Haas's book, <i>Writing Technology: Studies on the Materiality of Literacy</i>, she writes that historicizing is "the reciprocal process of placing computer literacy technologies into historical contexts and, in turn, using those historical contexts to more fully understand today's technologies." (205) This website will attempt to historicize the HTML tags used to create lists.
In Haas's article, "On the Relationship Between Old and New Technologies," she discusses the work of Lev Vygotsky and Frederick Engels. Haas writes the following:

<blockquote>Material tools mediate human encounters with the environment, and in so doing, transform not only the environment but the humans who use the tools as well. Vygotsky extended this notion of tools to include sign systems, and he referred to these sign systems as psychological tools. For Engels, the human hand is as much a product of labor as an instrument of it, and for Vygotsky, semiotic sign and <em>psychological tools</em> are the meditational means by which higher thinking develops. (212)</blockquote>

In other words, just as physical tools transform both the environment and the person who uses the tools, psychological tools transform both our media and our minds. In this website I will explore what this means in relation to the psychological tool of lists.<br><br><br>

            <summary>What Is a List?</summary><div class="sub2"><br>If letters and words are sign systems, then a list is a container for those sign systems. When you create a list, you are organizing your thoughts, like organizing objects in a drawer. When you create a list you are categorizing and sorting things. You are putting ideas into a container. A well-made list is a sign of an organized mind.

            <summary>A Brief History of Lists</summary><div class="sub2"><br>In <i>Orality and Literacy: The Technologizing of the Word</i>, Walter Ong argues that purely oral cultures did not use lists:
            "Writing make such apparatus possible. Indeed, writing was in a sense invented largely to make something like lists: by far most of the earliest writing we know, that in the cuneiform script of the Sumerians beginning around 3500 BC, is account-keeping. (99)" As evidence of the lack of lists before the written word, Ong shows that the written lists produced by primary oral cultures are fundamentally different from more literary cultures.


            <blockquote>In the text of the Torah, which set down in writing thought forms still basically oral, the equivalent of geography (establishing the relationship of one place to another) is put into a formulary action narrative (Number 33:16 ff): 'Setting out from the desert of Sinai, they camped at Kibroth-hattaavah. Setting out from Kibroth-hattaavah, they camped at Hazeroth. Setting out from Hazeroth, they camped at Rithmah...'."</blockquote>

            Another example Ong gives is of the genealogic "begat" section of <i>Genesis</i>: "'Irad begat Mahajael, Mahajael begat Methusael, Methusael begat Lamech'." This structure is the result of the following oral drives:
            <ul>
              <li>the oral drive to use formulas.</li>
              <li>the oral drive to exploit mnemonic balance with a subject-object-predicate.</li>
              <li>the oral drive for redundancy (each name appears twice) to aid memory.</li>
              <li>the oral drive to narrate (the "begats" provide action).</li>
            </ul>
            Pure lists, therefore, don't appear until writers move beyond a primary oral culture. "Primary oral cultures commonly situate their equivalent of lists in narrative. (Ong 99)" Once a culture is no longer primarily oral, pure lists appear, stripped of all narrative and memory-aiding devices.<br><br></div>

              <summary>The First Markup Language List Tags</summary><div class="sub2"><br>In HMTL there are two common list types:
              <ul>
                <li>Unordered lists.<br> These are defined by the &lt;ul&gt; tag. Individual items in an unordered list are defined by the &lt;li&gt; tag.</li>
                <li>Ordered lists.<br> These are defined by the &lt;ol&gt; tag. Individual items in an ordered list are again defined by the &lt;li&gt; tag.</li>
              </ul>
              These tags are actually older than HTML. The precursor to HTML was Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML). These list tags actually predate SGML. About a decade before SGML was invented, there was IBM's GML (named after it's creators, Charles <b>G</b>oldfarb, Edward <b>M</b>osher, and Raymond <b>L</b>orie, the "GML" was retroactively defined to mean "Generalized Markup Language"). The list tags we use in HTML were first developed in GML. The idea behind GML was to separate content from format. A document with GML contains text. That text is marked up with tags that define what kind of text it is (such as paragraphs, headers, and lists). Different systems can read those tags and format the document correctly. Just as the oldest known writings contain lists, the earliest markup languages contain list tags. The tags looked a little different, but if you can read HTML, you can figure out what these tags mean:
              <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Generalized_Markup_Language">
                :h1.Chapter 1:  Introduction<br>
 :p.GML supported hierarchical containers, such as<br>
 :ol.<br>
 :li.Ordered lists (like this one),<br>
 :li.Unordered lists, and<br>
 :li.Definition lists<br>
 :eol.
              </blockquote>
              Separating format from content makes the writer more conscious of formatting choices; you have to make deliberate decisions about the format outside of the text itself. This process makes the writer more thoughtful about these choices.<br><br>

                        <summary>HTML List Tags</summary><div class="sub2"><br>The HMTL list tags are identical in appearance to their precursors in SGML. You have the same &lt;ul&gt;, &lt;ol&gt;, and &lt;li&gt; tags. While they look the same, the HTML lists are more powerful in what they are able to do. The HTML lists can contain hypertext; they can link and be linked. The most important element on almost every website on the internet is basically just a linked list: the menu bar. (Historically, most menu bars were coded as unordered lists. There is ongoing debate about whether or not this is still optimal, such as <a href="https://css-tricks.com/navigation-in-lists-to-be-or-not-to-be/" target="_blank"> here.</a>) <br><br>
                        The menu bar is really just a linked list showing the contents of a website. Just as a list can show how something is organized, the menu bar shows how the website is organized. Just as creating a list can organize one's thoughts, creating a menu bar for a website is an act of organizing that site's content.<br><br>

                  <summary>List Memory</summary><div class="sub2"><br>As previously discussed, lists created by primary oral cultures contain built-in memory aids. Even as these early lists were being recorded, they were still thought of as something that would have to be remembered and recited. As cultures move away from the oral tradition, they drop these memory aids; the written list eventually functions in place of memory. Once we think of the list primarily as a written record, memory-aiding devices such as redundancy and narrative are no longer necessary.<br><br>
                  When we move from written lists to HTML lists, this change in how we remember things goes even further. While a list that you write yourself will most likely contain no memory-aiding devices, the simple act of making the list can help you create a memory. For example, consider a grocery list. When you make a grocery list, you take time to think of all the things you need. You write them down. Often, once you get to the store, you find that you no longer need the list. Making the list stored the memory. <br><br>
                  A list found on the internet is unlikely to have the same effect. In fact, just <i>knowing</i> that the list exists on the internet makes you less likely to remember what it contains. As a culture, we are using the internet as our memory. As a result, we are less able to remember things. However, we are experts at finding information.
 <br><br>
                  As mobile technology becomes more ubiquitous, we will rely more and more on technology to do our remembering for us. The website <a href="http://appcrawlr.com/ios/collection/apps-to-remember-everything" target="_blank">appcrawlr.com</a> has a list of over 200 ios applications under the category "remember everything." These apps don't actually help you remember. Instead, they do the remembering for you. <br><br>

                  The same appcrawlr.com website has a list of the "Top 100" list-making applications. Many of these allow you to share your lists much like you share posts in a social network. In this way, we can make lists specifically to help our forgetful friends and families remember things.<br><br>

              <summary>XML and DITA</summary><div class="sub2"><br>Writing with technology is becoming increasingly modular. People reading on their computers or mobile devices don't want to read through large amounts of information. Instead, they want to quickly get to the specific piece of information they need and then move on. In addition, companies are targetting their content to a range of audiences and devices. The technological solution this is XML.<br><br>

                 "XML promises capabilities to separate form from content; to use specific, customized markup to describe content; and to use a standard solution without depending on proprietary tools or formats." (p. 1, Priestley) The concept behind XML is very similar to the concept behind the original markup language, GML, with the separation of content and format. For example, in GML, "there are no sequence numbers for the ordered list items; they are generated during formatting." (P. 9, Goldfarb) In XML, the amount of specialized formatting available is unlimited, but the concept is the same. <br><br>

                With XML and DITA, you can specify formatting for a specific kind of list. For example, to explain a task you can have the &lt;step&gt; element. This defines the list as a set of instructions, to be formatted accordingly. If separating format and content makes writers more deliberate in their choices, then the more specialized those choices are, the more deliberate those writers have to be. All content can be analyzed and parsed for its specific audience and purpose.<br><br>

                Just as an organized list is a sign of an organized mind, an unorganized list is a sign of an unorganized mind. In this example from <i>The Late Show</i>, the joke is the inability of the writers to organize their thoughts.  <br><br>
